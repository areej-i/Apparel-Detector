# Apparel-Detector

This project attempts to identify articles of clothing based on images of people. 

In my implementation, I am using a Google colab notebook to run the detection software, which requires mounting your Google Drive to run.

I have included a folder called images, and a folder called customTF2. The images will used for testing. Please add these two folders to your drive. Do not place them inside another folder.

Next, upload the ApparelDetection.ipynb file to your drive. This is the google colab folder which you will be running.

Follow the instructions listed on the colab and you can simply run all of the commands via your desktop. You may be asked for permission to mount your drive and be warned about high ram use, just click accept to these. Run the scripts in order and wait for each to finish first before proceeding to the next one.

For more information about the project, please check out the ApparelDetector.pdf, which is a research paper highlighting my process.
